Each individual has a birth rate (births per unit time), $r$. In a short time, $dt$, we would expect $r \\times dt$ new births for each individual. Thus, in a population of size $N$ there will be $rNdt$ births. So the ODE equation for change in population size is","","$$ \\frac{dN}{dt}  = rN $$","","where $r$ is the growth rate per individual per unit time. The solution of this equation is exponential growth i.e.","","$$ N(t) = N(0) e^{rt}$$","","where $N(0)$ is the initial population at time $t = 0$.","","For a stochastic simulation, the probability that an individual gives birth in a short time, $dt$, is given by $r dt$. The same probability applies to each of the $N$ individuals. Hence the number of new births will be binomially distributed:","","$$ \\mbox{births in time } dt \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N, rdt) $$",""]},"defaultCode":["r <- user(0.1)    # Growth rate","N_init <- user(1) # Initial population size","","dt <- 0.01","time <- step * dt","","# Deterministic solution","initial(N_det) <- N_init","update(N_det) <- N_init * exp(r * time)","","# Stochastic solution","initial(N_stoch) <- N_init","","n_birth <- rbinom(N_stoch, r * dt)","","update(N_stoch) <- N_stoch + n_birth",""]}}
